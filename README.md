## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python :)
- ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨ I'm an Indonesian (I use English as my learning)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anyone
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...?
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: wh@t th3 fvck?

### I'd like to describe something (with python!):
```bash
#!$PREFIX/bin/python
# file name: $HOME/github/bio/Obsession.py

def ObsessedWith(doing_exciting_things):
    while True:
        print(f"I am {doing_exciting_things} all the time")

```
```bash
#!$PREFIX/bin/python
# file name: $HOME/github/bio/Idontgiveafuck.py

from Obsession import ObsessedWith as Obs

Object = input("What makes you excited? ")

def OtakuMe():
    if Object.lower() == "watching anime":
        Obs(Object)
    elif Object.lower() == "reading manga":
        Obs(Object)
    elif Object.lower() == "learn to code":
        Obs(Object)
    else:
        Obs("do something")

OtakuMe()
```
